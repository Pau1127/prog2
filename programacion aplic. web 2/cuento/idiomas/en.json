    "titulo": "The Poor Lion",
    "cuento": "Every day at the zoo, people would come to see the animals: the bears, monkeys, giraffes, lions, etc. Everyone thought all the lions were in their cages, but... that wasn’t the case; there was a big lion in a much smaller cage.\n\nOne day, a man went to hit him with a whip, and the guard did nothing because nobody liked the lion—except for the cleaning lady. She always gave this lion some meat secretly because she had raised him from a cub. The lion’s name was Sadness, and I’m not kidding—that was really his name. Coincidence, right?\n\nSadness didn’t know how to attack or hunt; he was fed on plates, like a dog or a cat, which made him tame, so he never learned what other lions knew. One night, the cleaning lady came to Sadness's cage with a big backpack. When she set the bag on the ground, he sniffed it, sensing the smell of meat, and the lady said:\n\n- I’ve come to train you so you can learn to hunt.\n\nEvery Wednesday and Friday night, the lion was trained; then, on Monday night, the lady came back without the backpack.\n\n- Sadness, I’ve been training you these past nights so I can set you free, so you can get your own food out there in the wild.\n\nSo, they made the journey; when they arrived, they had a heartfelt goodbye. Time passed, and Sadness found a lioness and they formed a beautiful family, being very happy. He was no longer Sadness, but of course, you can't just change the name of someone raised with that fame. Meanwhile, back at the zoo, the lady became the head of the zoo and declared a rule of equality for all animals."
