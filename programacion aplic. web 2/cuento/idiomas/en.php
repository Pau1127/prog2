    'cuento' => "Every day at the zoo, people went to see the animals, the bears, monkeys, giraffes, lions, etc., which, if I keep naming them I won't be able to narrate the story. Everyone thought that all the lions were in their cage, but it was not like that, there is a great lion that is locked in a smaller cage.

    One day a man went to beat him with a whip, the guard did not say anything, because nobody wanted the lion, except for the cleaning lady, she always gave meat to this lion secretly, besides she had raised him. The lion was called Tristón and I'm not kidding, but that's what it was called, coincidence, right?

    Tristón didn't know how to attack or hunt; they gave him food in plates, like dogs or cats, that is, they domesticated him so he didn't learn what the others knew. One night the cleaning lady went to the lion's cage, she was carrying a backpack quite big. When she left the backpack on the ground, Tristón sniffed it, sensing the smell of meat, and the lady told him:
    
    - I come to train you so that you learn to hunt.
    
    Every Wednesday and Friday night the lion was trained. On Monday night, the lady returned but without carrying the backpack:
    
    - Tristón, I have come to train you the previous days, to be able to free you, so you can get your own food there in the jungle.
    
    So they made the trip; when they arrived, they had a very affectionate farewell.
    
    Some time passed and Tristón found a lioness and they formed a beautiful family, being very happy, so he would no longer be Tristón, but you cannot change the name of anyone who was already raised with such fame. On the other hand, in the zoo, the lady became the boss of the zoo and she declared the law of equality between all animals."
